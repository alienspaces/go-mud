## Characters

Characters are created and begin their adventure at the start of a dungeon.

## Actions

Characters are controlled with actions that are simple sentences.

### Movement Actions

Character can `move` from one location to another location using the `move [direction]` action.

**Syntax Examples:**

```text
move north
move southwest
move up
```

Possible directions:

- north
- northeast
- east
- southeast
- south
- southwest
- west
- northwest
- up
- down

### Look Actions

A character can `look` to get a description of their current location, look in a specific direction, at an object, at another character or at a monster that is at the current location.

When a character looks at an object that is not in their possession a brief description of the object will be provided. To look more closely at an object, a character must have the object equipped or stashed in their backpack.

When a character looks a direction a brief description of the location will be provided. To get a more detailed view of a location a character must move to that location.

**Syntax Examples:**

```text
look
look north
look chest
look goblin
```

### Equip, Stash and Drop Actions

üìù _Partly Implemented_

A character may `equip` an object that is stashed in their backpack or at the current location. Any item that is currently equipped where the newly equipped item would normally be equipped, will be automatically stashed if there is enough room in the character's backpack. If there is not enough room in a character's backback to stash an already equipped object, equipping the new object will fail.

A character may `stash` an object that is currently equipped or at the character's current location into their backpack. If there is not enough room in a characters backback to stash an object, stashing the object will fail.

A character may `drop` any item that is currently equipped or stashed in their backpack. If there is not enough room at the character's current location to drop the object, dropping the object will fail.

**Syntax Examples:**

```text
equip sword
stash gold hammer
drop dragon tongue
```

### Loot Actions

üìù _Unimplemented_

A character may `loot` any other monster or character that has reached it's demise at the current location. All looted items will be automatically stashed. Objects that could not be looted due to the character running out of room in thier backpack will remain on the corpse. Once a monster or character has been completely looted, they disappear.


### Use Actions

üìù _Unimplemented_

A character may attempt to `use` any object that is equipped, stashed or in their current location. Some items may only be used when equipped or stashed.

**Syntax Examples:**

```text
use sword
use door
```

### Attack Actions

üìù _Unimplemented_

A character may attempt to `attack` any monster or character in the same room with any equipped object that can cause damage. By default the object in the characters main hand will be used. Otherwise you may specify the object that is held in the characters main or off hand.

**Syntax Examples:**

```text
attack Grumpy Dwarf
attack Grumpy Dwarf with Rusted Dagger
```
