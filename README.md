## Quick Start

üìù _Might be a good idea to look at what these tools do before running them!_

### Running the server

Starts a [`postgres`](https://www.postgresql.org/) database in a [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) container, runs database migrations with [`db-migrate`](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), loads game data and starts the [`Go`](https://go.dev/) API server.

```bash
cd backend
./tools/start
```

API server will be available at [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)

### Running the client

Generate client configuration code.

```bash
cd frontend
./tools/generate.dart
```

Use your favourite Flutter project IDE and Android/iOS emulator.
