## Server

üìù _Look at what these scripts actually do before running them!_

### Setup

Attempts to install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), [`nestjs`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) and [`package.json`](./server/package.json) defined dependencies.

```bash
cd server
./script/setup
```

### Start Server

Starts a [`postgres`](https://www.postgresql.org/) database in a [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) container, runs database migrations with [`db-migrate`](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), loads game data and starts the [`Go`](https://go.dev/) API server.

```bash
cd server
./script/start
```

### Start Client

Generate client configuration code.

```bash
cd client
./script/start
```

Use your favourite Flutter project IDE and Android/iOS emulator.
