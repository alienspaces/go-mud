## API Design

The API is designed to emulate the experience of hand typed commands with responses that describe the result of that command.

Each time a command is submitted an event is created. Responses include the results of the command along with the names and descriptions of locations, characters, monsters and objects that are present at the location when the event occurred.

All other events that occurred in the same location as the character since their previous command will also be returned. This way a character is given a running commentary of other events that have occurred in that location.

All character commands, monster commands and other automatic location events can occur at most, every two seconds.

A game client could choose to automatically submit a single `look` command for a character every two seconds when the player is detected as idle to retrieve any other events that have occurred.
